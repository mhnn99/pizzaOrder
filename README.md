# PizzaOrderWebsite


## Project description:
This was a team project by that time, as a team we have learned just the basics of WEB development. Throughout this project we managed to create a website for the fictional local pizza joint 'PizzaExpress'.

 ## Tehnologies Used : 
 - ExpressJS : to start the backend of the website
 - JavaScript : to implement the logic of the website
 - Bootstrap, HTML & CSS : to render and stylise the frontend

 - NodeJS : to emulate the frontend and backend


## Challenges :
At that point in time some of the challenges we've encountered were:
- Styling for different resolutions
- Storing the form


## Setup
### Backend setup
- Access the `server` directory and afterwards run the command `npm install` followed by `nodemon server.js` or `npx nodemon server.js` to start the backend of the website.
- You shall be prompted with the following message in the terminal:

### Frontend setup
- Open a new terminal and access the `client` directory and run the command `npm install`.
- Access the `backend` directory and afterwards run the command `nodemon server.js` or `npx nodemon server.js` to start the website's interface.
- If you'll access the `http://127.0.0.1:9003/` URL on any browser now you shall be able to access the website.


## How to use 
The website can be navigated by clicking on the icons, each one redirecting to another route:
- `/menu` : for the website's menu where you can add pizzas to your basket and filter them based on their allergens
